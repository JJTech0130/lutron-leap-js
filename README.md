# lutron-leap

This is an implementation of the Lutron LEAP protocol, used in *non-pro* Lutron Smart Hubs. It is effectively a port of [pylutron-caseta](https://github.com/gurumitts/pylutron-caseta) that I intend to use with Homebridge. Lots of the patterns in this code were cargo-culted straight out of [ldapts](https://github.com/ldapts/ldapts) because I am, like, _not_ a Typescript programmer.

Check the tests for examples of usage.
